An array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements, of same memory size, each identified by at least one array index or key. An array is stored such that the position of each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula.

## Difference between 1D and 2D array in C
In computer programming, arrays are a fundamental type of data structure that lets us efficiently store and manage data. They are a group of related data elements that are kept in close proximity to one another in memory. The programming language C supports one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) arrays. In this blog post, we will cover the distinctions between 1D & 2D arrays in C. But before discussing the differences, you must know about 1D and 2D array with their advantages and disadvantages.

## One-Dimensional Array
A linearly organized collection of identical data type elements is referred to as a One-Dimensional (1D) array. A 1D array's items are kept in a single and continuous region in memory, and each element is accessible via its index. An array's initial element always has an index 0, and its last element always has an index n-1, where n is the array's size.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of One-Dimensional Array
There are various advantages and disadvantages of the 1D array. Some main advantages and disadvantages of the 1D array are as follows:

## Advantages
They are easy to learn and use.
Comparatively speaking, they need less memory than 2D arrays.
They can be accessed more quickly because only one index is needed.
Disadvantages

They cannot accurately represent intricate data structures.
In the case of larger datasets, they can be challenging to read and analyze.

## Two-Dimensional Array
A 2D array is a group of identical data-type components arranged in a grid-like pattern. Essentially, it is an array of arrays, where each array corresponds to a grid row. A 2D array's items are kept in a single and continuous area in memory, and each one may be reached using its row and column indices. The row number is represented by the first index, and the column number is represented by the second index.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Two-Dimensional Array
There are various advantages and disadvantages of the 2D array. Some main advantages and disadvantages of the 2D array are as follows:

## Advantages
They can represent intricate data structures like matrices and tables.
They offer an effective method for grid-like data storage and manipulation.
For larger datasets, they can be quickly visualized and analyzed.

## Disadvantages
When compared to 1D arrays, they require more memory.
They require two indices, so accessing takes longer.
